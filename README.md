## Alpine Linux docker image with Oracle Java 8

This image is based on [AlpineLinux](http://alpinelinux.org/) and uses precompiled
glibc by [sgerrand](https://github.com/sgerrand/alpine-pkg-glibc/) to fetch and run
Oracle JDK 8u141-b15.

This is not the smallest, nor the best Alpine image with Oracle Java on top of it,
you should check out https://github.com/frol/docker-alpine-oraclejdk8 or
https://github.com/anapsix/docker-alpine-java/ for that.
